DO the following this time

1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
   - CycleGAN: Use CycleGAN to enhance the dataset from 800 normal and 800 lesion images to a total of 40,000 images.

2. Statistical Techniques:
   - Employ statistical techniques to ensure the quality and validity of the generated data. This could include measures like (use all of them to enusre our generated data is best):
     - Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID): To assess the similarity between the generated images and real images.
     - t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): For visualizing high-dimensional data to check for realistic distribution of generated images.
     - Inception Score (IS): To evaluate how realistic the generated images are and how diverse they are.

3. Advanced Classification Techniques:
   - After augmenting the dataset, use the following advanced techniques to compare performance:

      A. Attention U-Net:
         - Combine U-Net with attention mechanisms to improve focus on relevant areas in medical images.
         - Utilize pre-trained encoders, such as ResNet or DenseNet, within the U-Net architecture to use transfer learning and enhance performance.

      B. Attention-based Models:
         - Vision Transformers (ViTs): Implement ViTs to leverage their ability to focus on different parts of the image, potentially improving lesion detection and classification.
